# 📱 Google Play Store Data Analysis

# 📋 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from the **Google Play Store** to uncover insights about app popularity, user ratings, pricing strategies, and category performance.  
The analysis was conducted in **Python using Google Colab**, and the cleaned dataset ('googleplaystore.csv') is included in this repository.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** googleplaystore.csv
- **Source:** Google Play Store Dataset  
- **Description:**  
  Contains detailed information about Android apps, including:
  - App category and content rating  
  - Number of reviews and installs  
  - Ratings and prices  
  - App size and Android version requirements  

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python   
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and null values  
   - Standardized categorical columns  
   - Converted data types and normalized numerical columns  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized rating distributions  
   - Identified top-performing app categories  
   - Explored relationships between installs, price, and ratings  
   - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for rich data visualizations  

3. **Key Insights**
   - Free apps dominate the Play Store ecosystem  
   - "Family" and "Games" are the most popular app categories  
   - Paid apps tend to have slightly higher ratings on average  
   - Larger apps (in MB) often belong to productivity or entertainment categories  

##  How to Run
1. Open a new notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Upload the dataset googleplaystore.csv to your Colab environment.  
3. Run the analysis code cells step-by-step to reproduce the results and visualizations.

##  Future Improvements
1. Integrate machine learning models to predict app success based on features  
2. Build an interactive dashboard 
3. Perform **sentiment analysis** on user reviews (if text data available)

## 🧾 Results Summary
The analysis provides valuable insights into what drives app success on the Google Play Store, helping developers and marketers make data-driven decisions on pricing, design, and user engagement.
